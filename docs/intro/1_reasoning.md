# Intro - Reasoning

So in a nutshell, it takes away complexity of using git conventional commits and semantic versioning. You are auto guided and auto corrected how correctly to perform it xD
u only need correctly writing meaning/subject/description to your commits ðŸ™‚ but since u see what is rendered to users, you quickly learn how to write it better
Plus it was made in CI friendly way

why semantic versioning is important, to read here https://semver.org/
well, about git conventional commits is here: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

as an example, all my releases of darktool were made with similar automatation.
Changelogs and versions https://github.com/darklab8/darklab_freelancer_darktool/releases

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- CI friendly tool for automatic following of [Git Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) rules (standard for more descriptive commits)
- The tool generates automatically changelogs of new features and bug fixes for your product releases
- and also calculates next [semantic version](https://semver.org/) your next product release should be having

Essentially tool... To decrease toll on release documentation writing, and to start writing more descriptive commits \
It will help to make your repository looking like more professional in terms of commits, tags, versions, releases and changelogs. \
With ability to see quickly how your changelog looks like, it will motivate you to write more meaningful commits
